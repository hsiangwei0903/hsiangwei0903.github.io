I am a third year PhD student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington - Seattle. I hold a Master of Science degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Washington, and a Bachelor degree from the National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan.

Currently I am working with <a href="https://people.ece.uw.edu/hwang/">Prof. Jenq-Neng Hwang</a> and the <a href="https://ipl-uw.github.io/">Information Processing Lab</a>, with a strong focus on 3D Understanding and Large Multimodal Models.
