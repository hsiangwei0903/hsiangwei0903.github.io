permalink: /publications/mcmp
excerpt: 'Multi-camera multiple people tracking has become an increasingly important area of research due to the growing demand for accurate and efficient indoor people tracking systems, particularly in settings such as retail, healthcare centers, and transit hubs. We proposed a novel multi-camera multiple people tracking method that uses anchor-guided clustering for cross-camera re-identification and spatio-temporal consistency for geometry-based cross-camera ID reassigning. Our approach aims to improve the accuracy of tracking by identifying key features that are unique to every individual and utilizing the overlap of views between cameras to predict accurate trajectories without needing the actual camera parameters. The method has demonstrated robustness and effectiveness in handling both synthetic and real-world data. The proposed method is evaluated on CVPR AI City Challenge 2023 dataset, achieving IDF1 of 95.36% with the first-place ranking in the challenge.'

<!-- Ki-67 is a nuclear protein that can be produced during cell proliferation. The Ki67 index is a valuable prognostic variable in several kinds of cancer. In breast cancer, the index is even routinely checked in many patients. Currently, pathologists use the immunohistochemistry method to calculate the percentage of Ki-67 positive malignant cells as Ki-67 index. The higher score usually means more aggressive tumor behavior. In clinical practice, the measurement of Ki-67 index relies on visual identifying method and manual counting. However, visual and manual assessment method is timeconsuming and leads to poor reproducibility because of different scoring standards or limited tumor area under assessment. Here, we use digital image processing technics including image binarization and image morphological operations to create a digital image analysis method to interpretate Ki-67 index. Then, 10 breast cancer specimens are used as validation with high accuracy (correlation efficiency r = 0.95127). With the assistance of digital image analysis, pathologists can interpretate the Ki67 index more efficiently, precisely with excellent reproducibility.  -->
